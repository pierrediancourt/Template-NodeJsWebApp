Your node project is now running in development mode and reachable on http://localhost:3000 (port provided in the runNode.bat placed in the scripts folder as an environment variable)


///// OPTIONAL /////

If you want your default logged ubuntu user to be the root one when executing the bash command in a cmd.exe (which is done by the .bat scripts provided) so that you don't have to enter your password everytime, follow these instructions :

- Installation of the redis-desktop-manager-0.8.8.384.exe file
